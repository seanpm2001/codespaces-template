# A Wasp template on Github Codespaces

<img src="./src/client/waspLogo.png" width='100px'/>

This is a [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/) template configured for developer environments on [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

* Look for the `main.wasp` file to see how a Wasp App is built!
* The `src` directory contains your client and server files that you edit and reference within `main.wasp`
* Wasp uses this information to put all the pieces of your app together, so you can focus on the important stuff (you can see what Wasp builds in `.wasp/out`, but **don't** edit these files üêù)!
